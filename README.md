Sign up and sign in with authentication - bcryptjs (to hash password), jsonwebtoken to create a token to allow for authorization.

# Note: Read up on environment variables or ".env"

Important data (e.g. passwords) have been put in an environment varialble (.env) and as been put in a ".gitignore" file, which is not accessible to you.

Wherevever you see "process.env.{a name here}", the real data was hidden in an environment variable.

In order to use this, you need to create a ".env" file and store your data there (read up on ".env" and "dotenv" to understand better).

PS: Though the codes are well explained, I am assuming that the person who wants to make use of this repository already has a little knowledge in node.js. If you do not, it will be advisable to do that, in order to understand the codes better.
